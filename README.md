# IEOR Demand Prediction

This repository contains a project on demand prediction for the auto spare parts manufacturing industry. The goal of the project is to develop a mathematical model to determine the optimal production quantity of auto parts to meet the demand of various auto service centers across multiple regions with different climates.

[Report](https://github.com/Aayush-Goel-04/IEOR_Demand_Prediction/blob/main/ME308_Team54_Demand_Prediction.pdf) contains a detailed report of this project.
## Features

- A non-linear mathematical model that incorporates various factors, including climate, seasonal manufacturing, and expected time to failure (ETTF) of spare parts
- Various models have been described in report that explain the probabilty failure functions for auto parts.
- Data visualization tools to help understand the trends in demand and sales
- An interactive user interface to input parameters and get predictions for production quantity
